## About the project

Welcome! This is a repository that contains all files as required for UBC's STAT545B Assignment B1. This is an individual project completed in the second half of Fall Term as part of STAT545B: Exploratory Data Analysis II. In this project, I use the `tidyverse` to create an exploratory data analysis function that manipulates and plots data. The need for this function grew out of my Mini Data Analysis project using the [Vancouver Street Tree Dataset](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/street-trees/information/?disjunctive.species_name&disjunctive.common_name&disjunctive.on_street&disjunctive.neighbourhood_name) from the Open Data Portal, City of Vancouver, British Columbia. This dataset is accessed from the `datateachr` package and the function is then tested with the `testthat` package.
